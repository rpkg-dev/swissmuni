# TODOs

- [ ] Figure out what `incl_territory_exchange` really does!?

- [ ] Rename (tidy) the remaining column names returned by the API (so far only the `HR_*` columns can be renamed). But where to get necessary documentation?

- [ ] Add spinners to fetching op

- [ ] Add a vignette with some real-life usage examples.
