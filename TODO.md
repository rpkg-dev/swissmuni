# TODOs

-   Add progress indicator / spinner to fetching op

-   Add a vignette with some real-life usage examples any maybe write a blog post based on it (could be published on [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.org/post/)).

-   Rename (tidy) the remaining column names returned by the API (so far only the `HR_*` columns can be renamed). But where to get necessary documentation?
